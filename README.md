# WebTracker

the goal of this repo is to show the idea of using a composition approach to build a web tracker.

What are the issues we are trying to solve:
- Make the tracking tag more modular (ability to reuse modules)
- Get rid of the Manual Dependency Injection
- Make the pipeline configuration less couple to the features
